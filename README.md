Some tools to translate Debnosu_works games.
Still have many bugs.

### HOW TO USE
1. Can only be used on unencrytped games for now.
2. Use Garbro to extract the game.pak that will give you some .scb files in a script folder.
3. Copy those files in the `input_scb_files` folder now run `ext_scb.py` that will give you json files in `translatable_files` folder.
4. Translate the text in `TL key` (DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE).
5. When translation is done run `cr_scb.py`, You'll get the new files in `new_scb_files` folder.

##This game engine can read the files from folders so no need to repack files back.
